# Custom Dash Alternatives

There are a lot of more custom options to Dash. You can choose your own tools, which gives you more freedom, but will likely also be more time-consuming.

For this course, a Dash dashboard will most likely suffice for your research question.

Only use this if you have experience with this or are willing to spend more time learning all the dependencies.

## Example Custom Set-Up

An example set-up could include:

* **Vite + React + TypeScript** front-end
* **D3.js** for visualizations
* **Material UI** for layout and styling
* **Flask** server with a Python back-end

---

## Integration Resources

There are different ways to set up a Python back-end using Flask and a Vite + React front-end. A lot of examples can be found, for example:

* [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctQMqqEo4G8)
* [Medium article](https://medium.com/@colinatjku/integrating-flask-and-react-using-vite-for-development-and-nginx-in-production-a-microservices-9df7a21ca8f5)

On GitHub, you can find some example set-ups:

* [Flask-and-React by diegoperea20](https://github.com/diegoperea20/Flask-and-React)
* [Vite React TypeScript Admin Template](https://github.com/yldm-tech/vite-react-ts-admin-template)

Simply Google for `"flask vite react example"` and you will find a lot more tutorial examples.

## Libraries and Tools

Then, a lot of libraries exist that work with this set-up. You could for example use:

* [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to make graphs
* [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/) for styling
* [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/)
* [Tailwind](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)

## Final Notes

For this course, **Dash is more than sufficient**.
If you are interested, and confident that you have the time and skills for a different set-up, we have just presented a combination of tools that could be used.

However, you are also free to choose other tools you prefer.
**Likely, we can then not support you with the technical parts.**
