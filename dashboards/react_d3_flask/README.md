There are a lot of more custom options to Dash. You can choose your own tools, which gives you more freedom, but will likely also be more time-consuming. 

For this course, a Dash dashboard will most likely suffice for your research question

Only use this if you have experience with this or are willing to spend more time learning all the dependencies. 

An example set-up could include:
Vite + React + TypeScript front-end 
D3.js for visualizations
Material UI for layout and styling
Flask-server with Python back-end

There are different ways to set-up a Python back-end using Flask server and a Vite + React front-end. A lot of examples can be found, for example:

On GitHub, you can find some example set-ups:

https://github.com/yldm-tech/vite-react-ts-admin-template 

Simply Google for "flask vite react example" and you will find a lot more tutorials examples. 

Then, a lot of libraries exists that work with this set-up. You could for example use D3.js (https://d3js.org/) to make graphs. 

Also, like in the Dash example, you could use Bootstrap (https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/) for styling, however other options such as Material UI (https://mui.com/material-ui/) and Tailwind (https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app) exists. 

For this course Dash is more than sufficient. 
If you are interested, and confident that you have the time and skills for a different set-up, we have just presented with a combination of tools that could be used. 
However, you are also free to choose other tools you prefer. Likely, we can then not support you with the technical parts.
